## Overview

* Asymptotics is the term for the behavior of statistics as the sample size (or some other relevant quantity) limits to infinity (or some other relevant number)

### Simulations

- Fortunately, for the sample mean there's a set of powerful results

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
